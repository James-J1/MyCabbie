# MyCabbie
A test program for cab companies.
This program is designed to be akin to DoorDash or Uber Eats but for transportation companies. This allows a user to select which transportation service they would like to use and display a multitude of different vehicle types.
This will also allow companies to compete driving up sales/business in the form of special discounts or offers that incentivizes the user.
